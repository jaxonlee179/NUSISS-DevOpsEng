1. Update your `helloworld/application.py` file to change your application's output using GitHub's web interface. Observe the deployment pipeline and refresh your Application Endpoint. You can change the following line under the `get()` method:

    ```
    return Response(json.dumps({'Output': 'Hello World from Codestar'}), mimetype='application/json', status=200)
    ```
1. Capture screenshot of the failed build, save it along as part of your submission.
