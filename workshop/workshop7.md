# S-DOEA - Workshop 7 - End to end DevOps Engineering and Automation

## AWS Codestar with Python Flask Project

At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to push your code changes to Github and run it in an EC2 instance deployed AWS CodeBuild.

All of AWS services in this tutorial should be in the same region Sydney (ap-southeast-2).

## Pre-requisites
- Team workshop
- Github Account
- AWS Account
- Region : Sydney (ap-southeast-2)
- AWS EC2 Key Pair. [Follow this tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#having-ec2-create-your-key-pair) and take note of your Key Pair. *There is no need for us to ssh into a machine here so we can skip the `chmod` step in the guide.*

1. Capture screenshot of the successful build, save it along as part of your submission.

1. In the lower right side of the Project setup page, the application endpoint will show up when the deployment has finished loading. You can check the deployment status in the Continuous deployment section.

1. Click the Application Endpoint when it is ready and you should be able to see the JSON response of your Flask API.

1. Update your `helloworld/application.py` file to change your application's output using GitHub's web interface. Observe the deployment pipeline and refresh your Application Endpoint. You can change the following line under the `get()` method:

    ```
    return Response(json.dumps({'Output': 'Hello World from Codestar'}), mimetype='application/json', status=200)
    ```
1. Capture screenshot of the failed build, save it along as part of your submission.

2. Logon to the AWS Jenkins as below:-

* Jenkins Server 1
    - url : http://52.76.25.79/jenkins/

* Jenkins Server 2
    - url : http://3.24.33.126/jenkins/


3. Create a new freestyle project item with following naming convention ```'aws_dotnet_<your initial/group name>'```

4. Configure the jenkins job as below, make sure to replace all the userid in the screenshots

            Assert.Equal("Hello World!!!", response.output);
        }
```

7. Commit your codes to the github and watch how the build will fail.

8. Capture screenshot of the failed build, save it along as part of your submission.

9. Stabilize the test case before dockerized the app.

10. Create a Dockerfile on the root of the project directory for this dotnet project. *Hint shown  during lecturer day3.

11. Commit the Dockefile into your github repository.

12. Configure your jenkins's pre build step to publish this project's image to dockerhub. Use your own dockerhub username as the prefix of the image tag along with the dockerhub credentials.
