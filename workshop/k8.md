# S-DOEA - Workshop 8 - Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system for automating software deployment, scaling, and management. Google originally designed Kubernetes, but the Cloud Native Computing Foundation

This workshop only works on Windows machine

## Pre-requisites

- Docker installed
- Dockerhub Account
- Minikube installed

1. Create a sample node js web application

2. Dockerize your app

3. If there is any exist app already with the name first-app, delete the deployment plan

```
$ kubectl delete deployment first-app
```

4. Recreate the k8 deployment plan where it will retrieve docker image from your dockerhub account. (Make sure you already published your docker image to the hub)

```
$ kubectl create deployment first-app --image=kenken64/kub-first-app
```

5. Start the minikube service for first-app

```
$ minikube service first-app
```

6. Check on the k8 pods

```
kubectl get pods
```

7. Access the node js web app via http://localhost:28522

8. Lets test out the self healing feature when application is deployed to k8, access this end point on your web browser http://localhost:28522/error. This will result in crashing your app , kubernetes will auto restart your app automatically

9. Wait for 2 mins and try accessing the app again

10. Let us now scale the app to 3 replicas

```
kubectl scale deployment/first-app --replicas=3
```

11. Repeat step 8 and observe the behaviour of k8 in terms of how it will load balance to the exisitng runing pods. Check the status of the individual pos

```
$ kubectl get pods
```

12. Let us make some changes to the node js web app "change the page para from version 3 to 4"

13. Rebuild the docker image with a new tag and publish it

```
docker build -t kenken64/kub-first-app:2 .

docker push kenken64/kub-first-app:2
```

14. Make sure the deployment plan is still up and running

```
kubecctl get deployments
```

15. Update the deployment plan with the latest docker tag version

```
kubectl set image deployments/first-app kub-first=kenken64/kub-first-app:2

```

16. Check whether is the deployment plab rollout with the updates

```
kubectl get deployments
kubectl rollout status deployment/first-app
```

17. Access the node js web app via http://localhost:28522

18. Let us try rollback the updates of the app

```
kubectl rollout undo deployment/first-app
```

19. Check whether is the deployment plab rollout with the updates

```
kubectl rollout status deployment/first-app
```
